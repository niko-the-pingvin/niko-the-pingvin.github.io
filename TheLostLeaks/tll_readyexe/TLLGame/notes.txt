// controls

// accessing different modes
mode.tll contains the mode in base64 (easily changable in launcher)

current modes are:
"WaveM" & "RNGM"
other modes such as:
"DevTools" and "ModeTests" are useless and will crash the game on purpose.

// sprite modifying
resources.tll contains the game sprites.
dev_resources wont change anything.

// how to???
to modify the game sprites you can make a copy of the resources folder in %localappdata%\TheLostLeaks
OR extract the resources.tll in 7zip or any other program that can extract zip files.
once zipped up the modified zip file, rename it back to "resources.tll" and make sure the resources folder with the sprites folder in it,
otherwise it refuses to load.

Renaming the main resources file is possible, as the game will ask for a valid resources file when not found.
The game will quit if it can't find the entered file somehow.
