    <div class="blogdetails">26.04.2024 update: the update is now in the launcher (IMPORTANT: reinstall the launcher from pingvin.zip)</div>
    <br><br>
    i added a new feature called: melee
    <br>
    which was supposed to be in the game since it ever started (along with an inventory system which i will never add)
    <br>
    <image src="./img/TLL Melee Example 1.png" class="blogimg"></image>
    <br>
    <div class="sidebyside">
        along with that i added a new grabbing mechanic while enemies are stunned
        <br>
        (disclaimer: the enemies wont find you stunning at all)
        <br>
        <br>
        and yes the water gun randomly freezes the enemy
        <image src="./img/TLL Stun Example 1.png" class="blogimg"></image>
    </div>
    <br>
    and i forgot to mention that when the enemies have a faint dark red outline 
    <br> then that means that you can strike em with a melee attack in order to stun them
    <br>
    <h2>tell me EVERYTHING NEW!!!</h2>
    melee attacks (parrying bullets included)
    <br>throwables (knives, discs, spikes)
    <br>stunnable & grabbable enemies
    <br>new player death screen & effect
    <br>2 new enemies
    <br>
    <br>(circle enemy included)
