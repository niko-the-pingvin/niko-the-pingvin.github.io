    blob inc was one of my cool platformer projects i used to work on a lot.
    <br>it had many things like a shop, level editor and tutorial levels (that kinda sucked)

    <br><br><div class="blogask">now you may be asking, what exactly is blob inc?</div>
    <br>its a not-so fun platformer game with the soundtrack and code being made by me
    <br>it had many elements inspired by the games: "Will You Snail" by Jonas Tyroller and "Pizza Tower" by Tour De Pizza
    <br><br>heres one of the tracks "Shop 64" i made using the Mario 64 soundfont:
